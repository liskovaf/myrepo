# Instructions

* Use Python
* Provide comments about your decision process, e.g. (Why have you chosen your approach or why did you choose particular model type?)
	* We are more interested in your thought process than the best possible result.
	* Can be a part of the jupyter notebook or in a separate file.
* Properly document your code.
* The output of the task should be a zip file containing the .py or .ipynb files allowing full reproducibility of your results.
* Send output to the same e-mail you have received this assignment from.


# Forecasting task

Provided dataset `sales_data.csv` contains sales data for a few articles in 2 stores.

Number of items sold, their price , promotion dummy and item category columns are provided. 

1. Perform exploratory data analysis

	* Describe the dataset, visualize, etc.
	* Comment on the data, trends you see, interesting observations you have noticed, etc. 


2. Estimate a model which predicts next days sales

	* Use proper validation scheme.
	* The type of model is up to you, you can try multiple different ones.
	* If needed construct additional features. 


3. Evaluate your models performance

	* Choose right metrics and evaluate your model. Comment on the results.


4. Provide discussion for following questions:

	* Which features do you think are the most important ones?
	* What additional data would you need to improve the model?
	* In your opinion do the provided data contain enough observations for this task?
